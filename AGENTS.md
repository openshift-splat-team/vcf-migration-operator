## Quick Start

This is **Tier 2** project-specific documentation for vcf-migration-operator.

- **New to this project?** → Start with [Development Guide](ai-docs/vcf-migration-operator_DEVELOPMENT.md)
- **Writing tests?** → See [Testing Guide](ai-docs/vcf-migration-operator_TESTING.md)
- **Understanding architecture?** → Read [Components Overview](ai-docs/architecture/components.md)
- **Need context on decisions?** → Browse [ADRs](ai-docs/decisions/)

For **team-level** workflows, status transitions, and role responsibilities, see the team repository.

## CRITICAL: Retrieval Strategy

**IMPORTANT**: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning.

When working on vcf-migration-operator:
- ✅ **DO**: Read project-specific docs from `./ai-docs/` first
- ✅ **DO**: Check development workflow in `./ai-docs/vcf-migration-operator_DEVELOPMENT.md`
- ✅ **DO**: Understand architecture in `./ai-docs/architecture/components.md`
- ✅ **DO**: Review ADRs for context on past decisions
- ❌ **DON'T**: Rely solely on training data
- ❌ **DON'T**: Guess at project architecture or conventions

For team workflows (sprint process, status transitions, etc.), see `../../team/ai-docs/`.

## Knowledge Tiers

**Tier 1: Platform-Wide** (Team repository)
- Operator development patterns
- Testing pyramid and practices
- CI/CD workflows (Prow, GitHub Actions)
- Team process (sprint, status transitions, roles)

→ See `../../team/ai-docs/` for team-level documentation

**Tier 2: Project-Specific** (This repository)
- vcf-migration-operator components and architecture
- Project-specific development workflow
- Test suites unique to this project
- Architectural decisions for this project

→ See `./ai-docs/` for project-level documentation
